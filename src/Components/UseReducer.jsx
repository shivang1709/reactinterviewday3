    <h1>  What is UseReducer Hook ?(Implementation)</h1>
  

    <li>

    The useReducer Hook is the better alternative to the useState hook and is generally more preferred over the useState hook when you have complex state-building logic or when the next state value depends upon its previous value or when the components are needed to be optimized.
    </li>
    <li>The useReducer hook takes three arguments including reducer, initial state, and the function to load the initial state lazily.</li>
